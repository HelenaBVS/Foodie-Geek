                <h5>
                    Crust:
                </h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>1 cup Brazil nuts (or any other nut like almonds or cashews)</span></li>
                    <li><span>1/2 cup shredded coconut (unsweetened)</span></li>
                    <li><span>2 tbsp coconut oil (melted)</span></li>
                    <li><span>2 tbsp honey (natural sweetener that adds moisture and acts as a preservative)</span></li>
                    <li><span>A pinch of salt (enhances flavors by balancing sweetness)</span></li>
                    <li><span><strong>Optional:</strong> 1 egg (adds richness and binds the crust when baked)</span></li>
                </ul>

                <h5>
                    Filling:
                </h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span>11 1/2 cups raw cashews (hydrated by soaking overnight in cold water or 1 hour in boiling water)</span>
                        <ul><li><span><em>Scientific Note:</em> Soaking cashews serves two purposes. First, it softens them, making them easier to blend into a smooth, creamy consistency. Second, soaking helps to reduce the levels of phytic acid (a natural compound found in nuts and seeds), which can inhibit the absorption of certain minerals like iron, zinc, and calcium in the body. This process, known as "activating" the nuts, makes them more digestible and nutritious.</span></li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>1/3 cup coconut oil or coconut fat (refined if you prefer a milder coconut flavor)</span>
                        <ul><li><em>Scientific Note:</em> Coconut oil solidifies when cooled, helping the cheesecake set without the need for gelatin. This oil is high in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are metabolized differently than other fats, potentially offering health benefits. Additionally, coconut oil has natural preservative properties due to its antibacterial and antifungal components, such as lauric acid.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>1/2 cup coconut milk (full-fat for creaminess)</span>
                        <ul><li><em>Scientific Note:</em> Coconut milk is rich in lauric acid, a fatty acid with potential antimicrobial properties. The fat content adds a silky texture to the filling and also acts as a natural preservative.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>1/2 cup honey (acts as a natural sweetener and preservative)</span>
                        <ul><li><em>Scientific Note:</em> Honey is hygroscopic, meaning it attracts and retains moisture, which helps keep the filling smooth and prevents it from drying out. Honey also has natural preservative qualities due to its low moisture content and acidic pH, which inhibit the growth of bacteria and yeast.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Zest and juice of 1 large lemon (Sicilian lemons are known for their sweeter, more aromatic flavor, while Tahiti lemons are more tart, offering a sharper citrus taste).</span>
                        <ul><li><em>Scientific Note:</em> Lemon juice provides acidity, which balances the sweetness and enhances the flavor. The zest contains essential oils that add a fragrant citrus aroma. The acidity also helps to preserve the freshness of the dessert.
                        </li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Fresh coconut meat (from one coconut, finely grated)</span>
                        <ul><li><em>Scientific Note:</em> The fresh coconut meat adds texture and natural sweetness, along with healthy fats and fiber. It also contains antioxidants that may help in preserving the freshness of the cheesecake.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>1 tsp vanilla extract (adds depth to the flavor profile)</span></li>
                    <li><span>Fresh mint leaves (optional, for a refreshing flavor)</span></li>
                </ul>

                <h5>
                    Topping:
                </h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><span> passionfruit pulp to taste (with seeds, provides a tart contrast to the creamy filling)</span></li>
                    <li><span>Fresh mint leaves (for garnish)</span></li>
                    <li><span>Toasted coconut flakes (optional, for texture and flavor)</span></li>
                </ul>

                <h4>
                    Instructions
                </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Prepare the Crust:</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li><span><strong>Preheat the oven to 175°C (350°F).</strong></span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Blend the Brazil nuts:</strong> Pulse the Brazil nuts in a food processor until they form a coarse meal, retaining some texture for crunch.</span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Add the shredded coconut, melted coconut oil, honey, and salt:</strong> Pulse until the mixture begins to clump together.</span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Optional:</strong> Add 1 beaten egg to the mixture for added richness and to help bind the crust when baked.</span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Press the mixture into the base of a springform pan:</strong> Use the back of a spoon or your hands to press it down evenly.</span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Bake the crust:</strong> If using the egg, bake for 10-12 minutes until lightly golden. If not, simply chill the crust while you prepare the filling.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h5>Prepare the Filling:</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li><span><strong>Hydrate the cashews:</strong> Drain the soaked cashews and blend them until smooth in a high-powered blender.</span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Add the coconut oil, coconut milk, honey, lemon juice, and lemon zest:</strong> Blend until smooth and creamy. The coconut oil will help the filling set as it cools, and its preservative properties help extend the shelf life of the cheesecake.</span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Incorporate the fresh coconut meat:</strong> Blend in the finely grated coconut for added texture and flavor.</span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Add the vanilla extract and fresh mint leaves (if using):</strong> Blend again to fully combine.</span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Taste and adjust sweetness:</strong> Add more honey if desired, blending until fully incorporated.</span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Pour the filling over the prepared crust:</strong> Smooth the top with a spatula.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h5>Chill the Cheesecake:</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li><span><strong>Refrigerate: </strong> Cover the cheesecake with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until fully set.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h5>Prepare the Topping:</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li><span><strong>Combine the passionfruit pulp:</strong> The tartnes of the passionfruit balances the creamy richness of the filling, while the seeds add a pleasant crunch.</span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Top the cheesecake:</strong> Pour the passionfruit mixture over the top once the cheesecake has set.</span></li>
                            <li><span><strong>Garnish:</strong> Add fresh mint leaves and toasted coconut flakes for extra texture and flavor.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h5>Serve:</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li><span><strong>Slice and enjoy:</strong> Carefully remove the cheesecake from the springform pan, slice, and serve chilled.</span></li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h4>The Why:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><span><strong>Cashew Filling:</strong> Cashews are rich in fats and proteins, which give the cheesecake a creamy consistency similar to that of traditional dairy-based cheesecakes. Soaking cashews not only softens them for easier blending but also reduces phytic acid, which can interfere with mineral absorption. This process, often referred to as "activating" the nuts, makes them more digestible and enhances their nutritional value.</span></li>
                    <li><span><strong>Coconut Oil and Coconut Milk:</strong> These ingredients are not only crucial for creating a creamy texture but also act as natural preservatives. Lauric acid in coconut oil has antimicrobial properties, and the fat content helps in setting the cheesecake without needing additional thickeners like gelatin.</span></li>

                    <li><span><strong>Honey:</strong> Beyond its role as a sweetener, honey has natural preservative properties. Its low moisture content and acidic nature inhibit the growth of microorganisms, helping to keep the cheesecake fresh longer.</span></li>

                    <li><span><strong>Lemon Juice and Zest:</strong> The acidity of lemon juice adds balance to the sweetness while also helping to preserve the dessert. The zest provides essential oils that contribute to the aroma and overall flavor profile.</span></li>
